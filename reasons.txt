a. A signal that perl5 people care about raku (instead of the two camps
   yelling at eatchother)

b. A signal the XS modules in perl5 can be performant in pure-raku
   
c. As an exercise (to John and me) into how write raku that is so close
   to the system (my XS uses quite a bit of internal hackery)

d. Motivate tadzik to write a slang for *me*
